  description: "# Overview\nUse the CTC Traders API to send departure and arrival\
    \ movements to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS)\nand to get messages\
    \ sent from customs offices of departure and destination.\n<br/><br/>\nYou can\
    \ use this version of the API to send both small messages (up to 5MB in size)\
    \ and large messages \n(up to 8MB in size). The large messages capability applies\
    \ only to POST endpoints. \nAlthough you can use the large messages functionality\
    \ of the API to send both large and small messages, \nyou cannot use the small\
    \ messages functionality of the API to send large messages.\n<br/><br/>\nFor a\
    \ detailed overview of v3.0 of the API and information about how to send large\
    \ messages, \nsee [CTC Traders API service guide](/guides/ctc-traders-service-guide/).\n"

      summary: Get all cached departures
      description: |
        Get all departure declarations sent to the customs office of departure within the past 60 days.
        You can filter for departure declarations updated before and/or after a specific date and time, and optionally filter for departure declarations with a specific EORI.
        For a multi-page query you can filter for a specific page, and optionally the number of items per page.
        Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.
        A successful response will include the total count of the number of movements and a Movement Reference Number (MRN) only after it has been allocated to a movement. <br/><br/> **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement.  Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

      summary: Send a declaration data message
      description: |
        Send a transit declaration to the customs office of departure to notify it that you wish to carry out a transit operation.

        This request is also called an ‘Declaration Data’ E_DEC_DAT (IE015) message.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response:

        - will contain a URI, which you can use to get the message status
        - will contain the departure ID specifying the departure returned
        - can also include an optional box ID, which you can use to match this movement to any messages received from the Push Pull Notifications API

        If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB), a successful response will include:

        - a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file

      summary: Get all cached messages related to a departure
      description: |
        Get all messages related to a specific departure declaration sent to the customs office of departure within the past 60 days.
        You can filter for departure declarations received before and/or after a specific date and time.
        Movements older than 60 days are archived, so any messages to related to them cannot be returned by the API.
        For a multi-page query you can filter for a specific page, and optionally the number of items per page.
        A successful response will include the total count of the number of messages and Movement Reference Number (MRN) only after it has been allocated to a movement. <br/><br/> The `status` parameter in a successful response can have the following values:

         - `Pending`: the file has not yet been uploaded or checks are not yet completed
         - `Processing`: the file has been received by us and the message is being processed
         - `Success`: the file has been processed successfully
         - `Failed`: there was a problem with the file and the message was not processed

        **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement.  Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

      summary: Send a message related to a departure
      description: |
        Send a message to the customs office of departure about a departure.

        For example, if you want to cancel a ‘Declaration Data’ E_DEC_DAT (IE015) message, you must send a ‘Declaration Invalidation Request’ E_DEC_INV (IE014) message to the office of departure.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response will contain a URI, a departure ID, and a message ID related to the departure that you can use to get the message status.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB), a successful response will include:

        - a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
        - a departure ID, specifying the departure to return
        - a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

        **Note:** If an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number has not been assigned to you, an HTTP 403 Forbidden error is returned.

        Get a message related to a specific departure and message ID that have been received within the past 60 days.
        For example, this could include ‘Declaration rejected’ or Movement Reference Number (MRN) allocated messages.
        Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API. <br/><br/> A successful response can be returned in one of the following formats based on the provided `Accept` header:

         - `application/vnd.hmrc.3.0+json-xml`: JSON-wrapped XML, where the message is provided as an XML string sent as part of JSON payload containing other metadata
         - `application/vnd.hmrc.3.0+json`: JSON, where the message is provided as a sub-document sent as part of a JSON payload containing other metadata

        The `status` parameter in a successful response can have the following values:

         - `Pending`: the file has not yet been uploaded or checks are not yet completed
         - `Processing`: the file has been received by us and the message is being processed
         - `Success`: the file has been processed successfully
         - `Failed`: there was a problem with the file and the message was not processed

        **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement.  Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

        Get all arrivals that have been updated within the past 60 days.
        You can filter for arrival notifications updated before and/or after a specific date and time, and optionally filter for arrival notifications with a specific EORI.
        For a multi-page query you can filter for a specific page and optionally the number of items per page.
        Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API. <br/><br/> **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement.  Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

      summary: Send an arrival notification message
      description: |
        Notify the customs office of destination that a transit movement has arrived at its final destination.

        This request is also called an ‘Arrival Notification’ E_ARR_NOT (IE007) message.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response:
        - will contain a URI that you can use to get the message status
        - will contain the arrival ID specifying the arrival returned
        - can also include an optional box ID, which you can use to match this movement to any messages received from the Push Pull Notifications API

        If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB), a successful response will include:
        - a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
        - will contain the arrival ID specifying the arrival returned
        - a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

        **Note:** If an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number has not been assigned to you, an HTTP 403 Forbidden error is returned.

      summary: Get all cached messages related to an arrival
      description: |
        Get all messages related to a specific arrival that have been received within the past 60 days.
        You can filter for arrival notifications received before and/or after a specific date and time.
        For a multi-page query you can filter for a specific page, and optionally the number of items per page.
        Movements older than 60 days are archived, so any messages related to them cannot be returned by the API. <br/><br/> **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement.  Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

      summary: Send a message related to an arrival
      description: |
        Send a message to the customs office of destination about an arrival.

        For example, if you are a trader at destination, you will send an ‘Unloading Remarks’ E_ULD_REM (IE044) message to the office of destination indicating that unloading of the goods has been completed.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response will contain a URI, an arrival ID, and a message ID related to the arrival, which you can use to get the message status.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB), a successful response will include:

        - a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
        - an arrival ID, specifying the arrival to return
        - a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

        **Note:** If an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number has not been assigned to you, an HTTP 403 Forbidden error is returned.
